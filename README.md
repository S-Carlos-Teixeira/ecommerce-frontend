# Project3 MERN E-Commerce

## Description
This is a full stack e-commerce website built with the MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node) stack. The website allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and purchase them. The website also allows users to register and login. As a Admin you can also create new products. The website is deployed on Netlify, and the API on fly.io the Back-end also uses MongoDB Atlas for the database.

## Getting Started

The project can be accessed on **[my GitHub profile on ecommerce-frontend repository,](https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/ecommerce-frontend)** **[and the Back-end on ecommerce-api repository.](https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/ecommerce-api)** <br>
This project is open source and can be downloaded, used and modified by anyone, as far as credit is given.

The project was made in a group of two, to be completed within 11 days, where I have been responsable for the Back-end and my partner, **[AlishanKably,](https://github.com/AlishanKably/Project-03)** for the Front-end. The project is split as it follows: <br>

1. 2 day of whiteboarding and singing off.
2. 5 days for research, development and coding.
3. 2 days to get a minimum viable project.
4. 1 day for polishing, bug fixing.
5. 1 day to present the completed project.

## Brief

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making a backend/frontend
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end.

## Planning

We started the project by planning the tasks and features we wanted to implement. We then split the tasks between us, and then I started to work on the Back-end. We used **[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)** to keep track of our progress and tasks.
 
The code management was done using **[GitHub,](https://docs.github.com/en)** as we were working on different project sides, we usually didn`t had any conflicts, but during the polishing / bug solving stage, we joined efforts on the front-end to solve some bugs and eventually some conflicts had hapened.
